# Class Core for the Tigra Framework

Tigra's Core class

This is the heart of the Tigra Framework!

The repository 'RudyMas/tigra' contains the structure and some pre-configured files of the Framework. tigra_core provides the logic behind it.

The Core is made for my Tigra Framework, so it will be difficult to add this one to your own projects. But if you want to try it, you can install the package through composer.
````
composer require tigra/core
````

or by editing composer.json yourself and adding:
````
"require": {
    "tigra/core": "*"
}
````

The only documentation provided will be in the class-file itself!
