# RudyMas/tiger_core
Tiger's Core class

This is the heart of the Tiger Framework!

The repository 'RudyMas/tiger' contains the structure and some pre-configured files of the Framework. tiger_core provides the logic behind it.

It's made for my framework, so it will be difficult to add this one to your own projects. But if you want to try it, you can install the package through composer.
````
composer require tiger/core
````

or by editing composer.json yourself and adding:
````
"require": {
    "tiger/core": "*"
}
````

The only documentation provided will be in the class-file itself!
